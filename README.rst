`expyfun`_
=========

This package is designed for audio-visual experiments with precise timing,
and includes functionality for Eyelink control. This package is designed
with the purpose that it be used by specific labs and is currently **not**
designed for public use.

Therefore, while we welcome bug reports and suggestions from others,
NO SUPPORT IS GUARANTEED. Moreover, we can and will change the API as
necessary to suit the needs of the lab. Thus, use at your own risk.

Note that lab calibration logs can be stored `here
<https://github.com/LABSN/expyfun/wiki/Calibration-log>`_.

`The API documentation and examples can be found here
