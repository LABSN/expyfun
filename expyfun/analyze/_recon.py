def restore_values(correct, other, idx):
    """Restore missing values from one sequence using another

    Parameters
    ----------
    correct : array
        1D array of correct values.
    other : array
        1D array of other values that have missing components.
    idx : array
        Indices of the values in correct that are missing from other.
        If None, they will be estimated from the data.

    Returns
    -------
    other : array
        Array of other values, with interpolated values inserted.
    idx : array
        Array of indices that were interpolated.

    Notes
    -----
    This function works even if ``correct`` and ``other`` have different
    scales and shifts. Consider an experiment where the stimulus start
    times were saved by ``ExperimentController`` but the Eyelink system
    missed a ``SYNCTIME`` -- this function allows the proper sample numbers
    to be accurately estimated.
